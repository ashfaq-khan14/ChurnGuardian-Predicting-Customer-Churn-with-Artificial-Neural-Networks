## Overview
Customer churn prediction is a critical task for businesses to retain customers and improve customer satisfaction. This project aims to develop a machine learning model capable of predicting customer churn based on various features such as customer demographics, transaction history, interaction patterns, and customer sentiment. By identifying customers at risk of churning, businesses can take proactive measures to retain them and enhance customer loyalty.

## Dataset
The project utilizes a dataset containing customer information, including demographics, transaction history, interaction logs, customer sentiment scores, and churn labels (churned or not churned). The dataset is collected from the company's customer database or CRM system and may be augmented with external data sources for better predictive performance.

## Features
- *Demographic Information*: Customer attributes such as age, gender, income, education level, marital status, and occupation.
- *Transaction History*: Information about past purchases, frequency of transactions, monetary value, product/service usage, subscription plans, and contract terms.
- *Interaction Patterns*: Customer engagement metrics such as website visits, app usage, email interactions, customer support tickets, and social media interactions.
- *Customer Sentiment*: Sentiment analysis of customer feedback, reviews, and survey responses to gauge customer satisfaction and loyalty.
- *Churn Label*: Binary label indicating whether the customer has churned (1) or not churned (0).

## Models Used
- *Logistic Regression*: Simple and interpretable baseline model for binary classification tasks, suitable for initial analysis and interpretation.
- *Random Forest*: Ensemble method for improved predictive performance, capable of handling nonlinear relationships in data and capturing feature importance.
- *Gradient Boosting*: Boosting algorithm for enhanced accuracy and efficiency, especially useful for imbalanced datasets and capturing complex interactions.
- *Neural Networks*: Deep learning models for capturing intricate patterns in high-dimensional data, particularly effective for text and image features.

## Evaluation Metrics
- *Accuracy*: Measures the proportion of correctly classified instances among all instances.
- *Precision*: Measures the proportion of true positive predictions among all positive predictions.
- *Recall*: Measures the proportion of true positive predictions among all actual positive instances.
- *F1 Score*: Harmonic mean of precision and recall, providing a balance between the two metrics.
- *ROC AUC*: Area under the Receiver Operating Characteristic curve, representing the model's ability to discriminate between positive and negative instances.

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   
   git clone https://github.com/ashfaq-khan14/customer-churn-using-ANN.git
   
2. Install dependencies:
   
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   

## Usage
1. Preprocess the dataset (if necessary) and prepare the features and target variable.
2. Split the data into training and testing sets.
3. Train the machine learning models using the training data.
4. Evaluate the models using the testing data and appropriate evaluation metrics.
5. Fine-tune hyperparameters and select the best-performing model for deployment.

## Example Code
python
# Example code for training a Random Forest classifier
import pandas as pd
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier
from sklearn.metrics import classification_report

# Load the dataset
data = pd.read_csv('customer_data.csv')

# Split features and target variable
X = data.drop('Churn', axis=1)
y = data['Churn']

# Split the data into training and testing sets
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

# Initialize and train the classifier
classifier = RandomForestClassifier(n_estimators=100, random_state=42)
classifier.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Predict on the testing set
y_pred = classifier.predict(X_test)

# Evaluate the classifier
print(classification_report(y_test, y_pred))


## Future Improvements
- *Feature Engineering*: Explore additional features such as customer sentiment, product usage patterns, and customer feedback sentiment to improve model performance.
- *Advanced Modeling Techniques*: Experiment with advanced machine learning algorithms such as neural networks or gradient boosting for capturing complex relationships and improving predictive accuracy.
- *Customer Segmentation*: Segment customers based on their characteristics and behavior to tailor retention strategies more effectively for different customer segments.
- *Real-time Monitoring*: Develop a system for real-time monitoring of customer churn indicators to enable proactive intervention and immediate response.

## Deployment
- *Integration with CRM Systems*: Integrate the trained model with existing Customer Relationship Management (CRM) systems for automated churn prediction and customer retention strategies.
- *Dashboard Visualization*: Develop a dashboard for business stakeholders to monitor churn prediction results, track key metrics related to customer retention efforts, and visualize customer churn trends over time.
